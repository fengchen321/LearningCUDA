## nsys profile
usage: nsys profile [<args>] [application] [<application args>]

	-b, --backtrace=

	   Possible values are 'lbr', 'fp', 'dwarf', or 'none'.
	   Select the backtrace method to use while sampling.
	   Select 'none' to disable backtrace collection.
	   Default is 'lbr'.

	-c, --capture-range=

	   Possible values are none, cudaProfilerApi, nvtx, hotkey.
	   When '-c cudaProfilerApi' is used, profiling will start only when cudaProfilerStart API is
	   invoked in the application.
	   When '-c nvtx' is used, profiling will start only when the specified NVTX range is
	   started in the application.
	   When '-c hotkey' is used, profiling will start only when the hotkey
	   set by '--hotkey-capture' is pressed in the application. This works for graphic apps only.
	   Note that you must enable CUDA or NVTX tracing of the target application
	   for '-c cudaProfilerApi' or '-c nvtx' to work.
	   When '-capture-range none' is used, cudaProfilerStart/Stop APIs and hotkey will 
	   be ignored and NVTX ranges will be ignored as collection start/stop triggers.
	   Default is none.

	--capture-range-end=

	   Possible values are 'none', 'stop', 'stop-shutdown', 'repeat[:N]' or 'repeat-shutdown:N'.
	   Specify the desired behavior when a capture range ends. Applicable only when used along
	   with --capture-range option.
	   If 'none', capture range end will be ignored.
	   If 'stop', collection will stop at capture range end. Any subsequent capture ranges will be
	   ignored. Target app will continue running.
	   If 'stop-shutdown', collection will stop at capture range end and session will be shutdown.
	   If 'repeat[:N]', collection will stop at capture range end and subsequent capture ranges
	   will trigger more collections. 
	   Use the optional ':N' to specify max number of capture ranges to be honored. Any subsequent
	   capture ranges will be ignored once N capture ranges are collected.
	   If 'repeat-shutdown:N', same behavior as 'repeat:N' but session will be shutdown after N
	   ranges.
	   For 'stop-shutdown' and 'repeat-shutdown:N', use --kill option to specify the signal to be
	   sent to target app when shutting down session.
	   Default is 'stop-shutdown'.

	--command-file=

	   Open a file that contains nsys switches and parse the switches. Note that
	   command line switches will override switches found in the command-file.

	--cpu-core-events=

	   CPU Core events to sample.
	   Possible values are (for example) '2,3,...'.
	   Use the '--cpu-core-events=help' switch to see the full list of events.
	   Multiple values can be selected, separated by commas only (no spaces).
	   Requires root privileges or a paranoid level of 0 or less.
	   Use the --event-sample switch to enable.

	--cpuctxsw=

	   Possible values are 'process-tree', 'system-wide', or 'none'.
	   Trace OS thread scheduling activity. Select 'none' to disable tracing CPU context switches. 
	   'system-wide' requires root privileges or a paranoid level of 0 or less.
	   If CPU IP/backtrace sampling is enabled, --cpuctxsw equals the --sample setting.
	   For example, if --sample=process-tree, then --cpuctxsw=process-tree.
	   If --sample=none and a target application is launched, the default is 'process-tree',
	   otherwise the default is 'none'.

	--cuda-event-trace=

	   Possible values are 'auto', 'true' or 'false'.
	   Trace CUDA Event completion on the device side, and get better correlation
	   support among CUDA Event APIs. Applicable only when CUDA tracing is enabled.
	   Note that 'CUDA Event' refers to the synchronization mechanism (cudaEventRecord,
	   cudaStreamWaitEvent etc.).
	   Enabling this feature may increase runtime overhead and the likelihood of false
	   dependencies across CUDA Streams, similar to CUDA Event's timing functionality
	   when cudaEventDisableTiming is not disabled.
	   'auto' will automatically turn off the trace if a target process has
	   CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_CONNECTIONS set to 1.
	   This switch requires CUDA driver 12.8 or higher. 
	   Default is 'false'. Application scope.

	--cuda-flush-interval=

	   Set the interval, in milliseconds, when buffered CUDA data is automatically saved to
	   storage. CUDA data buffer saves may cause profiler overhead. Buffer save behavior can be
	   controlled with this switch.

	   If the CUDA flush interval is set to 0 on systems running CUDA 11.0 or newer, buffers are
	   saved when they fill. If a flush interval is set to a non-zero value on such systems, 
	   buffers are saved only when the flush interval expires. If a flush interval is set and the
	   profiler runs out of available buffers before the flush interval expires, additional buffers
	   will be allocated as needed. In this case, setting a flush interval can reduce buffer
	   save overhead but increase memory use by the profiler.

	   If the flush interval is set to 0 on systems running older versions of CUDA, 
	   buffers are saved at the end of the collection. If the profiler runs out of available
	   buffers, additional buffers are allocated as needed. If a flush interval is set to a
	   non-zero value on such systems, buffers are saved when the flush interval expires.
	   A cuCtxSynchronize call may be inserted into the workflow before the buffers
	   are saved which will cause application overhead. In this case, setting a flush interval
	   can reduce memory use by the profiler but may increase save overhead.
	   Default is '0'. Application scope.

	--cuda-graph-trace=<granularity>[:<launch origin>]

	   Set the granularity and launch origin for CUDA graph trace.
	   Applicable only when CUDA tracing is enabled.

	   Possible values for <granularity> are 'graph' or 'node'.
	   If 'graph' is selected, CUDA graphs will be traced as a whole and node
	   activities will not be collected. This can reduce overhead to the minimal,
	   but requires CUDA driver version 11.7 or higher.
	   If 'node' is selected, node activities will be collected, but CUDA graphs
	   will not be traced as a whole. This may cause significant runtime overhead.
	   If CUDA driver version is 11.7 or higher, default is 'graph', otherwise default is 'node'.

	   Possible values for <launch origin> are 'host-only' or 'host-and-device'.
	   If 'host-only' is selected, only CUDA graphs launched from host codes will be traced.
	   If 'host-and-device' is selected, CUDA graphs launched from host codes and device codes
	   will both be traced. This is only supported when the granularity is set to 'graph' and
	   the CUDA driver is version 12.3 or higher. This may cause significant runtime overhead.
	   If granularity is set to 'graph' and the CUDA driver version is 12.3 or higher,
	   the default is 'host-and-device', otherwise default is 'host-only'.'.

	   Application scope.

	--cuda-memory-usage=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Track the GPU memory usage. Applicable only when CUDA tracing is enabled.
	   This feature may cause significant runtime overhead.
	   Default is 'false'. Application scope.

	--cuda-trace-all-apis=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   By default, Nsys skips some CUDA APIs that are not critical for 
	   performance analysis. If enabled, Nsys will trace all CUDA APIs,
	   including those less relevant to performance analysis.
	   Note that enabling this feature may cause significant runtime overhead.
	   Default is 'false'.

	--cuda-um-cpu-page-faults=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Track the CPU page faults that occur with Unified Memory.
	   Applicable only when CUDA tracing is enabled.
	   This feature may cause significant runtime overhead.
	   Default is 'false'. Application scope.

	--cuda-um-gpu-page-faults=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Track the GPU page faults that occur with Unified Memory.
	   Applicable only when CUDA tracing is enabled.
	   This feature may cause significant runtime overhead.
	   Default is 'false'. Application scope.

	--cudabacktrace=

	   Possible values are 'all','none','kernel','memory','sync','other'.
	   If tracing CUDA APIs, enable the collection of a backtrace when a CUDA API is invoked.
	   When selected, significant runtime overhead may occur.
	   Values may be combined using ','.
	   Each value except 'none' may be appended with a threshold after ':'.
	   Threshold is the duration, in nanoseconds, that CUDA APIs must execute before backtraces are
	   collected, e.g. 'kernel:500'.
	   Default value for each threshold is 80000ns (80us).
	   Note that CPU sampling must be enabled.
	   Default is 'none'. Application scope.

	-d, --duration=

	   Collection duration in seconds.
	   Default is 0 seconds.

	--dask=

            Possible values are 'functions-trace' or 'none'.
            'functions-trace' implies '--python-functions-trace=/opt/nvidia/nsight-systems/2025.3.2/target-linux-x64/PythonFunctionsTrace/dask.json',
            and will rename relevant threads to 'Dask Worker' and 'Dask Scheduler'.
            Default is 'none'.
            Implies '--trace=nvtx'.

	--debug-symbols=

	   Specify the paths to directories with symbol files.
	   Multiple directories can be selected, separated by a colon (':') only (no spaces).

	-e, --env-var=

	   Set environment variable(s) for application process to be launched.
	   Environment variable(s) should be defined as 'A=B'.
	   Multiple environment variables can be specified as 'A=B,C=D'

	(Experimental) --enable=<plugin_name>[,arg1,arg2,...]

	   Use the specified plugin.
	   The option can be specified multiple times to enable multiple plugins.
	   Plugin arguments are separated by commas only (no spaces).
	   Commas can be escaped with a backslash '\'. The backslash itself can be
	   escaped by another backslash '\\'. To include spaces in an argument,
	   enclose the argument in double quotes '"'.
	   To list all available plugins, use '--enable=help' command.

	--event-sample=

	   Enable event sampling.
	   Possible values are 'system-wide' or 'none'.
	   Select 'none' to disable event sampling.
	   The default is 'none'.
	   Use the '--cpu-core-events=help' and the '--os-events=help' switches to see the 
	   full list of events.
	   Requires root privileges or a paranoid level of 0 or less.
	   If event sampling is enabled and no events are selected, 
	   the CPU Core event 'Instructions Retired' is selected by default.

	(Deprecated) --event-sampling-frequency=

	   WARNING: This switch is no longer supported.
	   Please use the event-sampling-interval switch instead.

	--event-sampling-interval=

	   The interval between each event sample collection.
	   Minimum event sampling interval is '1' milliseconds.
	   Maximum event sampling interval is '1000' milliseconds.
	   The default is '10' milliseconds.

	--export=<format>[,<format>...]

	   Possible formats are: none sqlite hdf text json arrow arrowdir parquetdir
	   Create additional output file(s) based on the data collected.
	   If 'none' is selected, no additional files are created.
	   Default is 'none'. This option can be given more than once.

	-f, --force-overwrite=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   If true, overwrite all existing result files with same output filename
	   (QDSTRM, nsys-rep, SQLITE, HDF, TEXT, JSON, ARROW, ARROWDIR, PARQUETDIR).
	   Default is 'false'.

	--flush-on-cudaprofilerstop=

           If set to 'true', any call to cudaProfilerStop() will
           cause the CUDA trace buffers to be flushed. Note that the CUDA trace
           buffers will be flushed when the collection ends, irrespective of the
           value of this switch. Default value is 'true'.

	--ftrace=

	   Collect ftrace events.
	   Argument should list events to collect as: subsystem1/event1,subsystem2/event2.

	--ib-net-info-devices=

           A comma-separated list of NICs names.
           The NICs which ibdiagnet will use for networks discovery.
           This option creates the ibdiagnet files to be used for
           collecting network information.
           Example value: 'mlx5_0,mlx5_1'.
           If the --ib-net-info-output option is set then Nsight Systems will store the network information at this path.
           Otherwise it will be created at a temporary path
           and will be discarded after processing.
           If more than one NIC was specified, only the last network information file be saved.

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-congestion-device=<IB switch GUID>[,<IB switch GUID>...]

	   A comma-separated list of InfiniBand switch GUIDs.
	   Collect InfiniBand switch congestion events from switches identified by
	   the specified GUIDs.
	   This switch can be used multiple times.
	   Default is an empty list. System scope.
	   Use the --ib-switch-congestion-nic-device, --ib-switch-congestion-percent,
	   and --ib-switch-congestion-threshold-high switches to further control how
	   congestion events are collected.

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-congestion-nic-device=

	   The name of the NIC (HCA) through which InfiniBand switches will be
	   accessed. By default, the first active NIC will be used.
	   One way to find a NIC's name is via the `ibstat -l` command.
	   Example usage: --ib-switch-congestion-nic-device=mlx5_3

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-congestion-percent=

	   Percent of InfiniBand switch congestion events to be collected.
	   This option enables reducing the network bandwidth consumed
	   by reporting congestion events.
	   Values are in the [1,100] range. Default value is 50.

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-congestion-threshold-high=

	   High threshold percentage for InfiniBand switch egress port queue size.
	   When a packet enters an InfiniBand switch, its data is stored at an
	   ingress port buffer. A pointer to the packet's data is inserted into
	   the egress port's queue, from which the packet will be exiting the switch.
	   At that point, the threshold given by this command line argument is compared
	   to the egress queue data size. If the queue data size exceeds the threshold,
	   a congestion event is reported.
	   The threshold is given in percent of the ingress port size.
	   An egress port queue can point data coming from multiple ingress port
	   buffers, therefore the threshold can be bigger than 100%.
	   Values are in the (1,1023] range, default value is 75 percent.

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-metrics-device=<IB switch GUID>[,<IB switch GUID>...]

	   A comma-separated list of InfiniBand switch GUIDs.
	   Collect metrics from the specified InfiniBand switches.
	   This switch can be used multiple times.
	   Default is an empty list. System scope.

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-metrics-nic-device=

	   The name of the NIC (HCA) through which InfiniBand switches will be
	   accessed for performance metrics samples. By default, the first active NIC
	   will be used. One way to find a NIC's name is via the `ibstat -l` command.
	   Example usage: --ib-switch-metrics-nic-device=mlx5_3

	--kill=

	   Possible values are 'none', 'sigkill', 'sigterm', or signal number.
	   Send signal to the target application's process group when ending/shutting down profiling session.
	   Default is 'sigterm', so the application is terminated when profiling session ends/is shutdown.

	--mpi-impl=

	   Possible values are 'openmpi' or 'mpich'.
	   Specify the MPI implementation used by the application.
	   Use 'mpich' for MPICH and its derivatives.
	   Note that this switch is applicable only when --trace=mpi is specified.
	   If no MPI implementation is specified, nsys tries to automatically detect it based on the
	   dynamic linker's search path. If this fails, 'openmpi' is used.

	-n, --inherit-environment=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Inherit environment variables.
	   Default is 'true'.

	--nic-metrics=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Collect metrics from NIC/HCA devices.
	   Default is 'false'. System scope.

	--nvtx-domain-[include|exclude]=

	   Possible values are a comma-separated list of NVTX domains.
	   Choose the include or exclude option to (only) include or exclude the specified domains. The
	   options are mutually exclusive. 'default' filters the NVTX default domain. A domain with
	   this name and commas in a domain name have to be escaped with '\'.
	   Note that both switches are applicable only when --trace=nvtx is specified.

	-o, --output=

	   Output report filename.
	   Any %q{ENV_VAR} pattern in the filename will be substituted with the value of the 
	   environment variable.
	   Any %h pattern in the filename will be substituted with the hostname of the system.
	   Any %p pattern in the filename will be substituted with the PID of the target process or
	   the PID of the root process if there is a process tree.
	   Any %n pattern in the filename will be substituted with the minimal positive integer that is 
	   not already occupied.
	   Any %% pattern in the filename will be substituted with %.
	   Default is 'report%n'.

	--opengl-gpu-workload=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   If true, trace the OpenGL workload's GPU activity.
	   Note that this switch is applicable only when --trace=opengl is specified.
	   Default is 'true'. Application scope.

	--os-events=

	   OS events to sample.
	   Possible values are (for example) '0,3,...'.
	   Use the '--os-events=help' switch to see the full list of events.
	   Multiple values can be selected, separated by commas only (no spaces).
	   Use the --event-sample switch to enable.

	--osrt-backtrace-stack-size=

	   Set the stack dump size, in bytes, to generate backtraces for OS runtime libraries calls.
	   Default is 6144 (6 KiB).

	--osrt-backtrace-threshold=

	   Set the duration, in nanoseconds, that all OS  runtime  libraries calls must execute before
	   backtraces are collected.
	   Default is 80000 (80 microseconds).

	(Experimental) --osrt-file-access=

	   Collect file access data when tracing Operating System Runtime (osrt) APIs that interact
	   with files.
	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Default is 'false'.
	   Note: When set to 'true', the --osrt-threshold setting is ignored for APIs that interact
	   with files.

	--osrt-threshold=

	   Set the duration, in nanoseconds, that Operating System Runtime (osrt) APIs must execute
	   before they are traced. Values much less than 1000 may cause significant overhead and
	   result in extremely large result files.
	   Default is 1000 (1 microsecond).
	   Note: This setting is ignored for APIs that interact with files when --osrt-file-access
	   is set to 'true'.

	-p, --nvtx-capture=

	   Possible values are: `range@domain' to specify both range and domain, 
	   `range' to specify range in default domain, `range@*' to specify a range in any domain.
	   NVTX message and domain to trigger the profiling session.
	   '@' can be escaped with backslash '\'.
	   Note that this switch is applicable only when --capture-range=nvtx is specified.

	--python-backtrace=

	   Optional values are 'cuda' and 'none'. If no value is given, 'cuda' is assumed.
	   Collect Python backtrace event when tracing the selected API's trigger.

	   Python functions to trace.
	   Note that nvtx package must be installed on the target Python.
	   See '/opt/nvidia/nsight-systems/2025.3.2/target-linux-x64/PythonFunctionsTrace/annotations.json' as an example.
	   For PyTorch application, see predefined annotations at '/opt/nvidia/nsight-systems/2025.3.2/target-linux-x64/PythonFunctionsTrace/pytorch.json'.
	   For Dask application, see predefined annotations at '/opt/nvidia/nsight-systems/2025.3.2/target-linux-x64/PythonFunctionsTrace/dask.json'.

	--python-sampling=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Sample Python backtrace.
	   Default is 'false'.
	   Note: This feature provides meaningful backtraces for Python processes. 
	   When profiling Python-only workflows, consider disabling the CPU sampling option to reduce overhead.

	   Specify Python sampling frequency.
	   Minimum supported frequency is '1' (Hz).
	   Maximum supported frequency is '2000' (Hz).
	   Default is '1000' (Hz).

            when pytorch is imported.
            'functions-trace' is an alias to '--python-functions-trace=/opt/nvidia/nsight-systems/2025.3.2/target-linux-x64/PythonFunctionsTrace/pytorch.json'.
            The 'autograd-nvtx' and 'autograd-shapes-nvtx' options can be combined
            with the 'functions-trace' option by adding them separated by a comma.
            Default is 'none'.

	   is 'none'.

	--samples-per-backtrace=

	   Possible values are integers between 1 and 32.
	   The number of CPU IP samples collected for every CPU IP sample backtrace collected. For 
	   example, if set to 4, on the fourth CPU IP sample collected, a backtrace will also be 
	   collected. Lower values increase the amount of data collected. Higher values can reduce 
	   overhead and help reduce the number of CPU IP samples dropped. 
	   Default is 1. If DWARF backtraces are collected, the default is 4.

	--sampling-period=

	   Possible values are integers between 21607936 and 168812.
	   The number of Reference Cycles events counted before a CPU instruction pointer (IP)
	   sample is collected. 
	   If configured, backtraces may also be collected. The smaller the sampling period, the higher

	   Default is 'cuda,nvtx,osrt,opengl'. Application scope.

	--trace-fork-before-exec=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   If true, trace any child process after fork and before they call one of the exec functions.
	   Beware, tracing in this interval relies on undefined behavior and might cause your
	   application to crash or deadlock. This option is only available on Linux and Windows
	   target platforms.
	   Default is 'false'.

	--vulkan-gpu-workload=

	   Possible values are 'individual', 'batch', 'none', 'true' or 'false'.
	   If individual or true, trace each Vulkan workload's GPU activity individually.

## nsys launch


usage: nsys launch [<args>] [application] [<application args>]

	(Deprecated) -b, --backtrace=

	   WARNING: This switch is no longer supported.
	   Please set the --backtrace switch when using the start command instead.

	--command-file=

	   Open a file that contains nsys switches and parse the switches. Note that
	   command line switches will override switches found in the command-file.

	(Deprecated) --cpuctxsw=

	   WARNING: This switch is no longer supported.
	   Please set the --cpuctxsw switch when using the start command instead.

	--cuda-event-trace=

	   Possible values are 'auto', 'true' or 'false'.
	   Trace CUDA Event completion on the device side, and get better correlation
	   support among CUDA Event APIs. Applicable only when CUDA tracing is enabled.
	   Note that 'CUDA Event' refers to the synchronization mechanism (cudaEventRecord,
	   cudaStreamWaitEvent etc.).
	   Enabling this feature may increase runtime overhead and the likelihood of false
	   dependencies across CUDA Streams, similar to CUDA Event's timing functionality
	   when cudaEventDisableTiming is not disabled.
	   'auto' will automatically turn off the trace if a target process has
	   CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_CONNECTIONS set to 1.
	   This switch requires CUDA driver 12.8 or higher. 
	   Default is 'false'. Application scope.

	--cuda-flush-interval=

	   Set the interval, in milliseconds, when buffered CUDA data is automatically saved to
	   storage. CUDA data buffer saves may cause profiler overhead. Buffer save behavior can be
	   controlled with this switch.

	   If the CUDA flush interval is set to 0 on systems running CUDA 11.0 or newer, buffers are
	   saved when they fill. If a flush interval is set to a non-zero value on such systems, 
	   buffers are saved only when the flush interval expires. If a flush interval is set and the
	   profiler runs out of available buffers before the flush interval expires, additional buffers
	   will be allocated as needed. In this case, setting a flush interval can reduce buffer
	   save overhead but increase memory use by the profiler.

	   If the flush interval is set to 0 on systems running older versions of CUDA, 
	   buffers are saved at the end of the collection. If the profiler runs out of available
	   buffers, additional buffers are allocated as needed. If a flush interval is set to a
	   non-zero value on such systems, buffers are saved when the flush interval expires.
	   A cuCtxSynchronize call may be inserted into the workflow before the buffers
	   are saved which will cause application overhead. In this case, setting a flush interval
	   can reduce memory use by the profiler but may increase save overhead.
	   Default is '0'. Application scope.

	--cuda-graph-trace=<granularity>[:<launch origin>]

	   Set the granularity and launch origin for CUDA graph trace.
	   Applicable only when CUDA tracing is enabled.

	   Possible values for <granularity> are 'graph' or 'node'.
	   If 'graph' is selected, CUDA graphs will be traced as a whole and node
	   activities will not be collected. This can reduce overhead to the minimal,
	   but requires CUDA driver version 11.7 or higher.
	   If 'node' is selected, node activities will be collected, but CUDA graphs
	   will not be traced as a whole. This may cause significant runtime overhead.
	   If CUDA driver version is 11.7 or higher, default is 'graph', otherwise default is 'node'.

	   Possible values for <launch origin> are 'host-only' or 'host-and-device'.
	   If 'host-only' is selected, only CUDA graphs launched from host codes will be traced.
	   If 'host-and-device' is selected, CUDA graphs launched from host codes and device codes
	   will both be traced. This is only supported when the granularity is set to 'graph' and
	   the CUDA driver is version 12.3 or higher. This may cause significant runtime overhead.
	   If granularity is set to 'graph' and the CUDA driver version is 12.3 or higher,
	   the default is 'host-and-device', otherwise default is 'host-only'.'.

	   Application scope.

	--cuda-memory-usage=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Track the GPU memory usage. Applicable only when CUDA tracing is enabled.
	   This feature may cause significant runtime overhead.

	--cuda-trace-all-apis=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   By default, Nsys skips some CUDA APIs that are not critical for 
	   performance analysis. If enabled, Nsys will trace all CUDA APIs,
	   including those less relevant to performance analysis.
	   Note that enabling this feature may cause significant runtime overhead.
	   Default is 'false'.

	--cuda-um-cpu-page-faults=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Track the CPU page faults that occur with Unified Memory.
	   Applicable only when CUDA tracing is enabled.
	   This feature may cause significant runtime overhead.
	   Default is 'false'. Application scope.

	--cuda-um-gpu-page-faults=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Track the GPU page faults that occur with Unified Memory.
	   Applicable only when CUDA tracing is enabled.
	   This feature may cause significant runtime overhead.
	   Default is 'false'. Application scope.

	--cudabacktrace=

	   Possible values are 'all','none','kernel','memory','sync','other'.
	   If tracing CUDA APIs, enable the collection of a backtrace when a CUDA API is invoked.
	   When selected, significant runtime overhead may occur.
	   Values may be combined using ','.
	   Each value except 'none' may be appended with a threshold after ':'.
	   Threshold is the duration, in nanoseconds, that CUDA APIs must execute before backtraces are
	   collected, e.g. 'kernel:500'.
	   Default value for each threshold is 80000ns (80us).
	   Note that CPU sampling must be enabled.
	   Default is 'none'. Application scope.

	--dask=

            Possible values are 'functions-trace' or 'none'.
            'functions-trace' implies '--python-functions-trace=/opt/nvidia/nsight-systems/2025.3.2/target-linux-x64/PythonFunctionsTrace/dask.json',
            and will rename relevant threads to 'Dask Worker' and 'Dask Scheduler'.
            Default is 'none'.
            Implies '--trace=nvtx'.

	-e, --env-var=

	   Set environment variable(s) for application process to be launched.
	   Environment variable(s) should be defined as 'A=B'.
	   Multiple environment variables can be specified as 'A=B,C=D'

	   Default is `F12`.

	--mpi-impl=

	   Possible values are 'openmpi' or 'mpich'.
	   Specify the MPI implementation used by the application.
	   Use 'mpich' for MPICH and its derivatives.
	   Note that this switch is applicable only when --trace=mpi is specified.
	   If no MPI implementation is specified, nsys tries to automatically detect it based on the
	   dynamic linker's search path. If this fails, 'openmpi' is used.

	-n, --inherit-environment=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Inherit environment variables.
	   Default is 'true'.

	--nvtx-domain-[include|exclude]=

	   Possible values are a comma-separated list of NVTX domains.
	   Choose the include or exclude option to (only) include or exclude the specified domains. The
	   options are mutually exclusive. 'default' filters the NVTX default domain. A domain with
	   this name and commas in a domain name have to be escaped with '\'.
	   Note that both switches are applicable only when --trace=nvtx is specified.

	--opengl-gpu-workload=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   If true, trace the OpenGL workload's GPU activity.

	   with files.

	--osrt-threshold=

	   Set the duration, in nanoseconds, that Operating System Runtime (osrt) APIs must execute
	   before they are traced. Values much less than 1000 may cause significant overhead and
	   result in extremely large result files.
	   Default is 1000 (1 microsecond).
	   Note: This setting is ignored for APIs that interact with files when --osrt-file-access
	   is set to 'true'.

	-p, --nvtx-capture=

	   Possible values are: `range@domain' to specify both range and domain, 
	   `range' to specify range in default domain, `range@*' to specify a range in any domain.

	   full list of events.
	   Requires root privileges or a paranoid level of 0 or less.
	   If event sampling is enabled and no events are selected, 
	   the CPU Core event 'Instructions Retired' is selected by default.

	(Deprecated) --event-sampling-frequency=

	   WARNING: This switch is no longer supported.
	   Please use the event-sampling-interval switch instead.

	--event-sampling-interval=

	   The interval between each event sample collection.
	   Minimum event sampling interval is '1' milliseconds.
	   Maximum event sampling interval is '1000' milliseconds.
	   The default is '10' milliseconds.

	--export=<format>[,<format>...]

	   Possible formats are: none sqlite hdf text json arrow arrowdir parquetdir

	   argument that will be used as a tag. If a tag is provided, only options
	   relevant to the tag will be printed.
	   The available help menu tags for this command are:

	   backtrace, cpu, cuda, export, ftrace, gpu, interactive, metrics, network,
	   nic, os, output, pmu, range, sample, sampling, session, stats, switch, symbol,
	   symbols, and trace.

	--ib-net-info-devices=

           A comma-separated list of NICs names.
           The NICs which ibdiagnet will use for networks discovery.
           This option creates the ibdiagnet files to be used for
           collecting network information.
           Example value: 'mlx5_0,mlx5_1'.
           If the --ib-net-info-output option is set then Nsight Systems will store the network information at this path.
           Otherwise it will be created at a temporary path
           and will be discarded after processing.
           If more than one NIC was specified, only the last network information file be saved.
           Note that this option should not be used together with
           the --ib-net-info-files option.

	--ib-net-info-files=

           A comma-separated list of file paths.
           Paths of an existing ibdiagnet db_csv files, containing networks information data.
           Nsight Systems will read the networks information from these files.
           Don't use '~' alias within the path.
           Note that this option should not be used together with
           the --ib-net-info-devices option.

	--ib-net-info-output=

           Sets the path of a directory into which
           ibdiagnet network discovery data will be written.
           Use this option together with the --ib-net-info-devices option.
           Don't use '~' alias within the path.

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-congestion-device=<IB switch GUID>[,<IB switch GUID>...]

	   A comma-separated list of InfiniBand switch GUIDs.
	   Collect InfiniBand switch congestion events from switches identified by
	   the specified GUIDs.
	   This switch can be used multiple times.
	   Default is an empty list. System scope.
	   Use the --ib-switch-congestion-nic-device, --ib-switch-congestion-percent,
	   and --ib-switch-congestion-threshold-high switches to further control how
	   congestion events are collected.

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-congestion-nic-device=

	   The name of the NIC (HCA) through which InfiniBand switches will be
	   accessed. By default, the first active NIC will be used.
	   One way to find a NIC's name is via the `ibstat -l` command.
	   Example usage: --ib-switch-congestion-nic-device=mlx5_3

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-congestion-percent=

	   Percent of InfiniBand switch congestion events to be collected.
	   This option enables reducing the network bandwidth consumed
	   by reporting congestion events.
	   Values are in the [1,100] range. Default value is 50.

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-congestion-threshold-high=

	   High threshold percentage for InfiniBand switch egress port queue size.
	   When a packet enters an InfiniBand switch, its data is stored at an
	   ingress port buffer. A pointer to the packet's data is inserted into
	   the egress port's queue, from which the packet will be exiting the switch.
	   At that point, the threshold given by this command line argument is compared
	   to the egress queue data size. If the queue data size exceeds the threshold,
	   a congestion event is reported.
	   The threshold is given in percent of the ingress port size.
	   An egress port queue can point data coming from multiple ingress port
	   buffers, therefore the threshold can be bigger than 100%.
	   Values are in the (1,1023] range, default value is 75 percent.

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-metrics-device=<IB switch GUID>[,<IB switch GUID>...]

	   A comma-separated list of InfiniBand switch GUIDs.
	   Collect metrics from the specified InfiniBand switches.
	   This switch can be used multiple times.
	   Default is an empty list. System scope.

	(Experimental) --ib-switch-metrics-nic-device=

	   The name of the NIC (HCA) through which InfiniBand switches will be
	   accessed for performance metrics samples. By default, the first active NIC
	   will be used. One way to find a NIC's name is via the `ibstat -l` command.
	   Example usage: --ib-switch-metrics-nic-device=mlx5_3

	--nic-metrics=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Collect metrics from NIC/HCA devices.
	   Default is 'false'. System scope.

	-o, --output=

	   Output report filename.
	   Any %q{ENV_VAR} pattern in the filename will be substituted with the value of the 
	   environment variable.
	   Any %h pattern in the filename will be substituted with the hostname of the system.
	   Any %p pattern in the filename will be substituted with the PID of the target process or
	   the PID of the root process if there is a process tree.
	   Any %n pattern in the filename will be substituted with the minimal positive integer that is 
	   not already occupied.
	   Any %% pattern in the filename will be substituted with %.
	   Default is 'report%n'.

	--os-events=

	   OS events to sample.
	   Possible values are (for example) '0,3,...'.
	   Use the '--os-events=help' switch to see the full list of events.
	   Multiple values can be selected, separated by commas only (no spaces).
	   Use the --event-sample switch to enable.

	-s, --sample=

	   Possible values are 'process-tree', 'system-wide' or 'none'.
	   Collect CPU IP/backtrace samples. Select 'none' to disable sampling. 
	   'system-wide' requires root privileges or a paranoid level of 0 or less.
	   If a target application is launched, the default is 'process-tree', otherwise the default
	   is 'none'.

	--samples-per-backtrace=

	   Possible values are integers between 1 and 32.
	   The number of CPU IP samples collected for every CPU IP sample backtrace collected. For 
	   example, if set to 4, on the fourth CPU IP sample collected, a backtrace will also be 
	   collected. Lower values increase the amount of data collected. Higher values can reduce 
	   overhead and help reduce the number of CPU IP samples dropped. 
	   Default is 1. If DWARF backtraces are collected, the default is 4.

	--sampling-period=

	   Possible values are integers between 21607936 and 168812.
	   The number of Reference Cycles events counted before a CPU instruction pointer (IP)
	   sample is collected. 
	   If configured, backtraces may also be collected. The smaller the sampling period, the higher
	   the sampling rate. 
	   Note that lower sampling periods will increase overhead and significantly increase the size
	   of the result file(s). 
	   Default is 1350496. If DWARF backtraces are collected, the default is 2700992.

	--session=

	   Launch the application in the given session.
	   The option argument must represent a valid session name or ID as reported by 'nsys sessions
	   list'.

	   environment variable.
	   Any '%h' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with the hostname of the system.
	   Any '%%' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with '%'.

	--session-new=

	   Start the collection in a new named session. The option  argument represents the session
	   name.
	   The session name must start with an alphabetical character followed by printable or space
	   characters.
	   Any '%q{ENV_VAR}' pattern in the session name will be substituted with the value of the
	   environment variable.
	   Any '%h' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with the hostname of the system.
	   Any '%%' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with '%'.

	--stats=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   Generate summary statistics after the collection.
	   When set to true, an SQLite database file will be created after the collection.
	   Default is 'false'.

	(Experimental) --storage-metrics=

	   Collect throughput and operations metrics from storage devices.
	   For further information see:
	   https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/UserGuide/#storage-metrics-profiling

	   Default is 'true'.

## nsys stop


usage: nsys stop [<args>]

	-h, --help=[<tag>]

	   Print the command's help menu. The switch can take one optional
	   argument that will be used as a tag. If a tag is provided, only options
	   relevant to the tag will be printed.
	   The available help menu tags for this command are:

	   interactive, and session.

	--keep=

	   Specify the number of seconds prior to stop for which data should be retained. Older data will be discarded.
	   Default is 0 seconds which means all data from the start of the collection will be retained.

	--session=

	   Stop the collection in the given session. The option argument must represent a
	   valid session name or ID as reported by 'nsys sessions list'.
	   Any '%q{ENV_VAR}' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with the value of the
	   environment variable.
	   Any '%h' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with the hostname of the system.
	   Any '%%' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with '%'.

## nsys cancel

usage: nsys cancel [<args>]

	-h, --help=[<tag>]

	   Print the command's help menu. The switch can take one optional
	   argument that will be used as a tag. If a tag is provided, only options
	   relevant to the tag will be printed.
	   The available help menu tags for this command are:

	   interactive, and session.

	--session=

	   Cancel the collection in the given session. The option argument must represent a
	   valid session name or ID as reported by 'nsys sessions list'.
	   Any '%q{ENV_VAR}' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with the value of the
	   environment variable.
	   Any '%h' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with the hostname of the system.
	   Any '%%' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with '%'.

## nsys service


usage: nsys service [<args>]

	-h, --help=[<tag>]

	   Print the command's help menu. The switch can take one optional
	   argument that will be used as a tag. If a tag is provided, only options
	   relevant to the tag will be printed.

## nsys stats


usage: nsys stats [<args>] <input-file>

<input-file> : Read data from a .nsys-rep or exported .sqlite file.

	-f, --format <name[:args...][,name[:args...]...]>

           Specify the output format. The special name "." indicates the
           default format for the given output.

           The default format for console is:    column
           The default format for files is:      csv
           The default format for processes is:  csv

           Available formats (and file extensions):

             column     Human readable columns (.txt)
             table      Human readable table (.txt)
             csv        Comma Separated Values (.csv)
             tsv        Tab Separated Values (.tsv)
             json       JavaScript Object Notation (.json)
             hdoc       HTML5 document with <table> (.html)
             htable     Raw HTML <table> (.html)

           This option may be used multiple times. Multiple formats may also
           be specified using a comma-separated list. If a list item is left
           blank by using repeating commas, the last specified format (and args)
           will be repeated to fill in the blanks. If the list starts with a
           comma, creating an initial blank format, the default will be
           substituted.

	--filter-nvtx  <nvtx_range_name>[@<domain_name>][/<index>]

           Filter the events and data records used to generate reports by
           the time range defined by the first instance of the given NVTX
           range. Only events or records that overlap with any of the given
           NVTX range are used to compile and calculate the report. Note
           that an event or data record can start before or end after the
           given NVTX range, as long as it exists at some point during the
           specified NVTX range.

           The domain name is not optional, and can only be excluded if
           the range was not assigned to a domain; if the range has a
           domain it must be given.

           By default, the first instance of the given NVTX range (as
           defined by the start time) is used to define the time range. A
           different instance of the given NVTX range can be used by
           specifying an index number.  The index is zero-based, so the first
           instance has an index of "0". If the characters after the final
           slash do not represent a positive integer, it is assumed they
           are part of the range/domain name.

           If used in conjunction with the --filter-time option, this option
           will override any explicit time values.

	--filter-time  [<start_time>]/[<end_time>]

           Filter the events and data records used to generate reports by
           the given time range. Only events or records that overlap with
           any of the given time range are used to compile and calculate
           the report. Note that an event or data record can start before
           or end after the given time range, as long as it exists at some
           point during the specified time range.

           Times are defined in nanoseconds. At least one time value is
           required. Any omitted time value will default to the minimum or
           maximum value (approximately +/- 290 years from the zero-point).
           The start time must be less than or equal to the end time.

           The time values are a series of integer or floating-point values
           followed by an optional unit. If no unit is given, the number is
           assumed to be in nanoseconds. Positive and negative values are
           supported, as well as scientific "e" notation. More than one
           value/unit can be given as long as there are no spaces. The
           units do not need to be given in any order and can even repeat.

           The following units are understood:

              ns, nsec : nanosecond
              us, usec : microsecond
              ms, msec : millisecond
              s, sec   : second
              m, min   : minute (60 seconds)
              h, hour  : hour (3600 seconds)

           For example, the value "1s2ms3us4ns" would indicate 1,002,003,004
           nanoseconds. "2ns5us2" would be 5004 nanoseconds (2 nanoseconds
           plus 5 microseconds plus 2 nanoseconds). A floating-point value
           is converted as a 64-bit "double" and is subject to the precision
           limitations of that format.

           If used in conjunction with the --filter-nvtx option, the
           --filter-nvtx option will take precedence.

	--force-export [true|false]

           Force a re-export of the SQLite file from the specified .nsys-rep file,
           even if an SQLite file already exists.

	--force-overwrite [true|false]

           Overwrite any existing output file(s).

	-h, --help=[<tag>]

	   Print the command's help menu. The switch can take one optional
	   argument that will be used as a tag. If a tag is provided, only options
	   relevant to the tag will be printed.
	   The available help menu tags for this command are:

	   export, format, help, nvtx, output, report, reports, rule, sql, sqlite,
	   stats, status, time, and units.

	--help-formats [<format_name>|ALL]

           With no argument, list a summary of the available output formats.
           If a format name is given, a more detailed explanation of the
           the format is displayed. If 'ALL' is given, a more detailed
           explanation of all available formats is displayed.

	--help-reports [<report_name>|ALL]

           With no argument, list a summary of the available summary and
           trace reports. If a report name is given, a more detailed
           explanation of the report is displayed. If 'ALL' is given, a
           more detailed explanation of all available reports is displayed.

	-o, --output <output>

           Specify the output mechanism. There are three output mechanisms:
           print to console, output to file, or output to command. If no
           outputs are designated, the default is to print rules to the
           console.

           This option may be used multiple times. Multiple outputs may also
           be specified using a comma-separated list. If a list item is left
           blank by using repeating commas, the last specified output will be
           repeated to fill in the blanks. If the list starts with a comma,
           creating an initial blank output, the default will be substituted.

           If the given output name is "-", the output will be displayed
           on the console. If the output name starts with "@", the output
           designates a command to run. The nsys command will be executed and
           the analysis output will be piped into the command. Any other output
           is assumed to be the base path and name for a file.

           If a file basename is given, the filename used will be:

              <basename>_<analysis&args>.<output_format>

           The default base (including path) is the name of the SQLite file
           (as derived from the input file or --sqlite option), minus the
           extension. The output "." can be used to indicate the analysis
           should be output to a file, and the default basename should be
           used. To write one or more analysis outputs to files using the
           default basename, use the option: "--output .".

           If the output starts with "@", the nsys command output is piped to
           the given command. The command is run, and the output
           is piped to the command's stdin (standard-input). The command's
           stdout and stderr remain attached to the console, so any output
           will be displayed directly to the console.

           Be aware there are some limitations in how the command string is
           parsed. No shell expansions (including *, ?, [], and ~) are
           supported. The command cannot be piped to another command, nor
           redirected to a file using shell syntax. The command and command
           arguments are split on whitespace, and no quotes (within the command
           syntax) are supported. For commands that require complex command
           line syntax, it is suggested that the command be put into a shell
           script file, and the script designated as the output command.

	-q, --quiet

           Only display errors.

	-r, --report <name[:args...][,name[:args...]...]>

           Specify the report(s) to generate, including any arguments. This
           option may be used multiple times. Multiple reports may also be
           specified using a comma-separated list. If a list item is left
           blank by using repeating commas, the last specified report (and args)
           will be repeated to fill in the blanks. This allows the same report
           to be executed multiple times, possibly given different formats or
           outputs. If the list starts with a comma, creating an initial blank
           report name, that is considered an error.

           If no reports are given, the following will be used as the
           default report set:

             nvtx_sum
             osrt_sum
             cuda_api_sum
             cuda_gpu_kern_sum
             cuda_gpu_mem_time_sum
             cuda_gpu_mem_size_sum
             openmp_sum
             opengl_khr_range_sum
             opengl_khr_gpu_range_sum
             vulkan_marker_sum
             vulkan_gpu_marker_sum
             dx11_pix_sum
             dx12_gpu_marker_sum
             dx12_pix_sum
             wddm_queue_sum
             um_sum
             um_total_sum
             um_cpu_page_faults_sum
             openacc_sum
             syscall_sum

           See --help-reports for a list of built-in reports, along with more
           information on each report.

	--report-dir <path>

           Add one or more directories to the path used to find report scripts.
           This is usually only needed if you have one or more directories with
           personal scripts. This option may be used multiple times. Each use
           adds additional directories to the end of the path.

           A search path can also be defined using the environment variable
           "NSYS_STATS_REPORT_PATH". Directories added this way will
           be added after the application flags.

           The last two entries in the path will always be the current working
           directory, followed by the directory containing the packaged nsys
           reports.

	--sqlite <file.sqlite>

           Specify the SQLite export filename. If this file exists, it will
           be used. If this file doesn't exist (or if --force-export was given)
           this file will be created from the specified .nsys-rep file before
           processing. This option cannot be used if the specified input
           file is also an SQLite file.

	--timeunit <time unit>

           Set basic unit of time. The default is nanoseconds.
           Longest prefix matching is done on the following units:

              nsec nanoseconds usec microseconds msec milliseconds seconds

           Prefix matching means that, in addition to the full unit names,
           prefixes can be used to specify a time unit. For example, "sec" can
           be used to specify "seconds", "us" for "usec" (microseconds), or
           "milli" for "milliseconds". This is similar to passing a
           ":time=<unit>" argument to every formatter, although the formatter
           uses more strict naming conventions. See "nsys stats --help-formats
           column" for more detailed information on unit conversion.


  The "nsys stats" command generates a series of summary or trace reports.
  These reports can be output to the console, or to individual files. Reports
  can be presented in a variety of different output formats from human-readable
  columns of text, to formats more appropriate for data exchange, such as CSV.

  Reports are generated from an SQLite export of a .nsys-rep file. If a .nsys-rep file
  is specified, nsys will look for an accompanying SQLite file and use it. If
  no SQLite file exists, one will be exported and created.

  Individual reports are generated by calling out to plug-ins that read data
  from the SQLite file and return their report data in CSV format. Nsys ingests
  this data and formats it as requested, then displays the data to the console
  or writes it to a file. Adding new reports is as simple as writing a plug-in
  that can read the SQLite file and generate the required CSV output. See the
  shipped plug-ins as an example. Both reports and formatters may take arguments
  to tweak their processing.

  Reports are processed using a three-tuple that consists of 1) the report name
  (and any arguments), 2) the presentation format (and any arguments), and
  3) the output (filename, console, or external process). The first report
  specified uses the first format specified, and is presented via the first
  output specified. The second report uses the second format for the second
  output, and so forth. If more reports are specified than formats or outputs,
  the format and/or output list is expanded to match the number of provided
  reports by repeating the last specified element of the list (or the default,
  if nothing was specified).

  EXAMPLES

  This command will output the default reports to the console using the default
  ("column") format:

    $ nsys stats report1.nsys-rep


  This command will output the "cuda_gpu_trace" report to the console in column
  format:

    $ nsys stats --report cuda_gpu_trace report1.nsys-rep


  This command will generate three reports. The "cuda_gpu_trace" report will be
  output to the file "report1_cuda_gpu_trace.csv" in CSV format. The other two
  reports, "cuda_gpu_kern_sum" and "cuda_api_sum", will be output to the
  console as columns of data. Although three reports were given, only two
  formats and outputs are given. To reconcile this, both the list of formats
  and outputs is expanded to match the list of reports by repeating the last
  element:

    $ nsys stats --report cuda_gpu_trace --report cuda_gpu_kern_sum --report \
            cuda_api_sum --format csv,column --output .,- report1.nsys-rep


  This command generates one report, outputting the report to the "grep"
  command. The grep command is used to filter out everything but the header,
  formatting, and the "cudaFree" data, and displays the results to the console:

    $ nsys stats --report cuda_api_sum --format table \
            --output @"grep -E (-|Name|cudaFree)" test.sqlite

	   valid session name or ID as reported by 'nsys sessions list'.
	   Any '%q{ENV_VAR}' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with the value of the
	   environment variable.
	   Any '%h' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with the hostname of the system.
	   Any '%%' pattern in the option argument will be substituted with '%'.

## sys export

usage: nsys export [<args>] [nsys-rep-file]

	--append

           This option only applies to "directory of files" output formats
           with existing export files. If this option is given, an error
           will not be reported and the existing output files will not be
           over-written.

	-f, --force-overwrite=

	   Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
	   If true, overwrite all existing result files with same output filename
	   (QDSTRM, nsys-rep, SQLITE, HDF, TEXT, JSON, ARROW, ARROWDIR, PARQUETDIR).
	   Default is 'false'.

	-h, --help=[<tag>]

	   Print the command's help menu. The switch can take one optional
	   argument that will be used as a tag. If a tag is provided, only options
	   relevant to the tag will be printed.
	   The available help menu tags for this command are:

	   export, output, and type.

	--include-blobs [true|false]

           Optional values are 'true' or 'false'. If no value is given,
           'true' is assumed. If the flag is not given, the default is 'false'.

           Controls if NVTX extended payloads are exported as binary data. This
           affects SQLite, Arrow, and Arrow/Parquet directory exports only.

	--include-json [true|false]

           Optional values are 'true' or 'false'. If no value is given,
           'true' is assumed. If the flag is not given, the default is 'false'.

           Controls if repetitive JSON blocks are included in an export or not.

           Some events contain dynamically defined payloads. These payloads are
           often exported as JSON blocks to preserve their free-form structure.
           Unfortunately, blocks of JSON text are not an efficient way to
           represent data, and can cause the export files to become quite large.

           To address this, some classes of events (such as GENERIC_EVENT data)
           were extended to export payload data in the native export format.
           For those events that have an export-native representation, this flag
           will enable or disable the export of the equivalent JSON blocks.

           Note that this does not suppress all JSON output. Some tables, like
           META_DATA_* tables and TARGET_INFO_* tables may contain a small
           number of JSON strings. This flag will not suppress those.

           Additionally, some classes of events (such as ETW events and NVTX
           events with user-defined payloads) do not have a native export
           representation. For events where the JSON block is the only export
           format, it will always be included.

           Please note that this flag has nothing to do with JSON exports,
           (i.e. --type=json), nor does it alter the JSON export output.

	-l, --lazy=

           Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
           Controls if table creation is lazy or not. Lazy table creation will
           only create a table if it contains data. This affects SQLite, HDF5,
           Arrow, and Arrow/Parquet directory exports only. Default is 'true',
           although this is likely to change in a future release.

	-o, --output=

           Path to results file.
           Default is name of input file with modified extension.

	-q, --quiet=

           Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
           If 'true', don't display progress bar.
           Default is 'false'.

	--separate-strings=

           Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
           Output stored strings and thread names separately, one
           value per line. This affects JSON and text output only.
           Default is 'false'.

	-t, --type=

           Possible values are: sqlite, hdf, text, json, info, arrow,
           arrowdir, and parquetdir.

           Export format type.

             sqlite (.sqlite) -- SQLite v3 file. Data sets are stored as
             tables in a single SQLite file. Schema contains comments
             trying to explain meaning of tables/columns.

             hdf (.h5) -- HDF5. Data sets are stored in a single H5 file.

             text (.txt) -- Text. Raw event data is dumped in text format,
             as defined by the Google Protobuf library. File headers,
             generic events, and some other data is not included.

             json (.json) -- JSON file. Raw event data is dumped in JSON
             format, as defined by the Google Protobuf library. File headers,
             generic events, and some other data is not included.

             info (.info.json) -- JSON file.  Dump of header parts of file.

             arrow (.arrows) -- Apache Arrow IPC stream format. All data
             sets are stored in a single file sequentially. Meta-data is
             included to identify the table and meaning.

             arrowdir (_arwdir/*.arrow) -- Apache Arrow IPC file format.
             Each data set is stored in a single file.

             parquetdir (_pqtdir/*.parquet) -- Apache Parquet format. Each
             data set is stored in a single file.

           HDF format is supported only on x86-64 Linux and Windows.

	--tables=<pattern>[,<pattern>...]

           Value is a comma-separated list of search patterns (no spaces).
           This option can be given more than once. If set, only tables that
           match one or more of the patterns will be exported. If not set,
           all tables will be exported. This feature applies to SQLite, HDFS,
           Arrow, and Arrow/Parquet directory exports only. The patterns are
           case-insensitive POSIX basic regular expressions.

           Please note: This is an advanced feature intended for expert users.
           This option does not enforce any type of dependency or relationship
           between tables and will truly export only the listed tables. If
           partial exports are used with analytics features such as "nsys stats"
           or "nsys analyze", it is the responsibility of the user to ensure
           all required tables are exported.

	--times=<timerange>[,<timerange>...]

           Value is a comma-separated list of time ranges (no spaces). This
           option can be given more than once. If set, only events that fall
           within at least one of the given ranges will be exported. If not
           set, all events will be exported. This feature applies to SQLite,
           HDFS, Arrow, and Arrow/Parquet directory exports only.

           Please note: This is an advanced feature intended for expert users.
           This option does not enforce any type of dependency or relationship
           between related events (such as CUDA launch APIs and CUDA kernel
           executions). If filtered exports are used with analytics features
           such as "nsys stats" or "nsys analyze", no warnings or errors will
           be generated due to missing data, and unexpected or misleading
           results may be generated. It is the responsibility of the user
           to ensure all relevant and interrelated events are exported.

           The format of a time-range is:   [:][<start-time>]/[<end-time>][:]

           A single time range is defined by a pair of time values, separated
           by a slash. At least one time value is required. Any omitted time
           value will default to the minimum or maximum value (approximately
           +/- 290 years from the zero-point). The start time must be less
           than or equal to the end time.

           The time values are a series of integer or floating-point values
           followed by an optional unit. If no unit is given, the number is
           assumed to be in nanoseconds. Positive and negative values are
           supported, as well as scientific "e" notation. More than one
           value/unit can be given as long as there are no spaces. The
           units do not need to be given in any order and can even repeat.

           The following units are understood:

              ns, nsec : nanosecond
              us, usec : microsecond
              ms, msec : millisecond
              s, sec   : second
              m, min   : minute (60 seconds)
              h, hour  : hour (3600 seconds)

           For example, the value "1s2ms3us4ns" would indicate 1,002,003,004
           nanoseconds. "2ns5us2" would be 5004 nanoseconds (2 nanoseconds
           plus 5 microseconds plus 2 nanoseconds). A floating-point value
           is converted as a 64-bit "double" and is subject to the precision
           limitations of that format.

           By default, the time ranges have "strict" boundaries. The presence
           of a ":" character at the beginning and/or end of a time range
           makes that boundary "non-strict," meaning the filtered events are
           allowed to cross the boundary. In essence, if both boundaries are
           strict, the event must fully exist _within_ the defined range, but
           if both boundaries are "non-strict," the event must exist _during_
           the defined range. Given the following timeline, with a single
           filter range (marked START and END), the given events (marked
           with "=" characters) would be considered a match (T) or not (F),
           depending on the strictness of the filter's start/end boundaries.

                START     END             S/E   :S/E    S/E:  :S/E:
                  |  ====  |               T      T      T      T
            =============  |               F      T      F      T
                  |  ============          F      F      T      T
            =====================          F      F      F      T
            ===== |   or   | ====          F      F      F      F

           While many events have both a start and end time, some events only
           have a single timestamp. These types of events are treated as an
           event with a start time equal to the end time. If an event's end
           time is before the start time, the end time is adjusted to the
           start time.

           If used in conjunction with the --ts-normalize and/or --ts-shift
           options, the time filter is applied after the event's time values
           have been adjusted.

	--ts-normalize=

           Possible values are 'true' or 'false'.
           If true, all timestamp values in the report will be shifted to
           UTC wall-clock time, as defined by the UNIX epoch. This option can
           be used in conjunction with the --ts-shift option, in which case both
           adjustments will be applied.
           If this option is used to align a series of reports from a cluster
           or distributed system, the accuracy of the alignment is limited by
           the synchronization precision of the system clocks. For detailed
           analysis, the use of PTP or another high-precision synchronization
           methodology is recommended. NTP is unlikely to produce desirable
           results.
           This option only applies to SQLite, HDF5, Arrow, and Arrow/Parquet
           directory exports.
           Default is 'false'.

	--ts-shift=

           The value is a signed integer in nanoseconds.
           If given, all timestamp values in the report will be shifted by
           the given amount. This option can be used in conjunction with the
           --ts-normalize option, in which case both adjustments will be applied.
           This option can be used to "hand-align" report files captured at
           different times, or reports captured on distributed systems with
           poorly synchronized system clocks.
           This option only applies to SQLite, HDF5, Arrow, and Arrow/Parquet
           directory exports.
           Default is 0.

## sys analyze


usage: nsys analyze [<args>] <input-file>

<input-file> : Read data from a .nsys-rep or exported .sqlite file.

	-f, --format <name[:args...][,name[:args...]...]>

           Specify the output format. The special name "." indicates the
           default format for the given output.

           The default format for console is:    column
           The default format for files is:      csv
           The default format for processes is:  csv

           Available formats (and file extensions):

             column     Human readable columns (.txt)
             table      Human readable table (.txt)
             csv        Comma Separated Values (.csv)
             tsv        Tab Separated Values (.tsv)
             json       JavaScript Object Notation (.json)
             hdoc       HTML5 document with <table> (.html)
             htable     Raw HTML <table> (.html)

           This option may be used multiple times. Multiple formats may also
           be specified using a comma-separated list. If a list item is left
           blank by using repeating commas, the last specified format (and args)
           will be repeated to fill in the blanks. If the list starts with a
           comma, creating an initial blank format, the default will be
           substituted.

	--filter-nvtx  <nvtx_range_name>[@<domain_name>][/<index>]

           Filter the events and data records used to generate reports by
           the time range defined by the first instance of the given NVTX
           range. Only events or records that overlap with any of the given
           NVTX range are used to compile and calculate the report. Note
           that an event or data record can start before or end after the
           given NVTX range, as long as it exists at some point during the
           specified NVTX range.

           The domain name is not optional, and can only be excluded if
           the range was not assigned to a domain; if the range has a
           domain it must be given.

           By default, the first instance of the given NVTX range (as
           defined by the start time) is used to define the time range. A
           different instance of the given NVTX range can be used by
           specifying an index number.  The index is zero-based, so the first
           instance has an index of "0". If the characters after the final
           slash do not represent a positive integer, it is assumed they
           are part of the range/domain name.

           If used in conjunction with the --filter-time option, this option
           will override any explicit time values.

	--filter-time  [<start_time>]/[<end_time>]

           Filter the events and data records used to generate reports by
           the given time range. Only events or records that overlap with
           any of the given time range are used to compile and calculate
           the report. Note that an event or data record can start before
           or end after the given time range, as long as it exists at some
           point during the specified time range.

           Times are defined in nanoseconds. At least one time value is
           required. Any omitted time value will default to the minimum or
           maximum value (approximately +/- 290 years from the zero-point).
           The start time must be less than or equal to the end time.

           The time values are a series of integer or floating-point values
           followed by an optional unit. If no unit is given, the number is
           assumed to be in nanoseconds. Positive and negative values are
           supported, as well as scientific "e" notation. More than one
           value/unit can be given as long as there are no spaces. The
           units do not need to be given in any order and can even repeat.

           The following units are understood:

              ns, nsec : nanosecond
              us, usec : microsecond
              ms, msec : millisecond
              s, sec   : second
              m, min   : minute (60 seconds)
              h, hour  : hour (3600 seconds)

           For example, the value "1s2ms3us4ns" would indicate 1,002,003,004
           nanoseconds. "2ns5us2" would be 5004 nanoseconds (2 nanoseconds
           plus 5 microseconds plus 2 nanoseconds). A floating-point value
           is converted as a 64-bit "double" and is subject to the precision
           limitations of that format.

           If used in conjunction with the --filter-nvtx option, the
           --filter-nvtx option will take precedence.

	--force-export [true|false]

           Force a re-export of the SQLite file from the specified .nsys-rep file,
           even if an SQLite file already exists.

	--force-overwrite [true|false]

           Overwrite any existing output file(s).

	-h, --help=[<tag>]

	   Print the command's help menu. The switch can take one optional
	   argument that will be used as a tag. If a tag is provided, only options
	   relevant to the tag will be printed.
	   The available help menu tags for this command are:

	   export, format, help, nvtx, output, rule, rules, sql, sqlite, stats,
	   status, time, and units.

	--help-formats [<format_name>|ALL]

           With no argument, list a summary of the available output formats.
           If a format name is given, a more detailed explanation of the
           the format is displayed. If 'ALL' is given, a more detailed
           explanation of all available formats is displayed.

	--help-rules [<rule_name>|ALL]

           With no argument, list a summary of available rules. If a rule
           name is given, a more detailed explanation of the rule is
           displayed. If 'ALL' is given, a more detailed explanation of
           all available rules is displayed.

	-o, --output <output>

           Specify the output mechanism. There are three output mechanisms:
           print to console, output to file, or output to command. If no
           outputs are designated, the default is to print rules to the
           console.

           This option may be used multiple times. Multiple outputs may also
           be specified using a comma-separated list. If a list item is left
           blank by using repeating commas, the last specified output will be
           repeated to fill in the blanks. If the list starts with a comma,
           creating an initial blank output, the default will be substituted.

           If the given output name is "-", the output will be displayed
           on the console. If the output name starts with "@", the output
           designates a command to run. The nsys command will be executed and
           the analysis output will be piped into the command. Any other output
           is assumed to be the base path and name for a file.

           If a file basename is given, the filename used will be:

              <basename>_<analysis&args>.<output_format>

           The default base (including path) is the name of the SQLite file
           (as derived from the input file or --sqlite option), minus the
           extension. The output "." can be used to indicate the analysis
           should be output to a file, and the default basename should be
           used. To write one or more analysis outputs to files using the
           default basename, use the option: "--output .".

           If the output starts with "@", the nsys command output is piped to
           the given command. The command is run, and the output
           is piped to the command's stdin (standard-input). The command's
           stdout and stderr remain attached to the console, so any output
           will be displayed directly to the console.

           Be aware there are some limitations in how the command string is
           parsed. No shell expansions (including *, ?, [], and ~) are
           supported. The command cannot be piped to another command, nor
           redirected to a file using shell syntax. The command and command
           arguments are split on whitespace, and no quotes (within the command
           syntax) are supported. For commands that require complex command
           line syntax, it is suggested that the command be put into a shell
           script file, and the script designated as the output command.

	-q, --quiet

           Only display errors.

	-r, --rule <name[:args...][,name[:args...]...]>

           Specify the rule(s) to generate, including any arguments. This
           option may be used multiple times. Multiple rules may also be
           specified using a comma-separated list.

           If no rules are given, the following will be used as the
           default rule set:

              cuda_memcpy_async
              cuda_memcpy_sync
              cuda_memset_sync
              cuda_api_sync
              gpu_gaps
              gpu_time_util
              dx12_mem_ops

           See --help-rules for more information on each rule.

	--sqlite <file.sqlite>

           Specify the SQLite export filename. If this file exists, it will
           be used. If this file doesn't exist (or if --force-export was given)
           this file will be created from the specified .nsys-rep file before
           processing. This option cannot be used if the specified input
           file is also an SQLite file.

	--timeunit <time unit>

           Set basic unit of time. The default is nanoseconds.
           Longest prefix matching is done on the following units:

              nsec nanoseconds usec microseconds msec milliseconds seconds

           Prefix matching means that, in addition to the full unit names,
           prefixes can be used to specify a time unit. For example, "sec" can
           be used to specify "seconds", "us" for "usec" (microseconds), or
           "milli" for "milliseconds". This is similar to passing a
           ":time=<unit>" argument to every formatter, although the formatter
           uses more strict naming conventions. See "nsys stats --help-formats
           column" for more detailed information on unit conversion.
